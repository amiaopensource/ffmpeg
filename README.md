Hello! This project is now deprecated, but we very much recommend [ffmprovisr](https://github.com/amiaopensource/ffmprovisr).

There is unique content available available in the [wiki](https://github.com/amiaopensource/ffmpeg/wiki) of this repository.

Volunteers are needed to migrate data from the [wiki](https://github.com/amiaopensource/ffmpeg/wiki) to [ffmprovisr](https://github.com/amiaopensource/ffmprovisr#how-do-i-contribute).

Thanks.
